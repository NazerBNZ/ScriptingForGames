Hello I am Mercedes Nazer.
I am a freshman who is taking this class to apply to the animation and game developmemt program.
I have never used git before, so I am excited to learn. I enjoy drawing, reading, going on walks,
learning new things, and being creative. I try my best on everything I do, and hope I am doing all
of this correctly.
